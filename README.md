My name is Lucas Palharini. I'm currently studying at the Driven Education bootcamp.
By the age of 12 years, when I started using the computer, I got interested in programming.
I had to go a long way in and out of college until I realized that: 
Coding is what I like, is what I'm good with. And I know I can become an excelent developer in due time.
