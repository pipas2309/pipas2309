### 🌱 A little more about me...

My name is Lucas Palharini. I'm a Fullstack Developer, currently focusing on backend. Since I was 12 years old, when I started using the computer, I became interested in programming. I had to go a long way inside and outside of college until I realized that: Coding is what I like and I'm good at. Coding and having a good coffee is just amazing!

**Some extra facts about me:**

-    🌱 I'm currently studying Kotlin, Springboot, and architectures (like hexagonal);
-    💞️ I work with a modular monolith in Kotlin, besides projects in PHP and Node;
-    📚 I'm taking ADS and other materials focused on hexagonal architecture and SpringBoot;
-    🎮 I like to read, play video games, play with my cat and dog, and of course, enjoy a good time with my wonderful wife ♥;
-    ☕ I'm passionate about a good coffee, chocolate, and a strong and sweet Caipirinha :)

<br>

### 💼 Professional Experience

-   **Recent Challenges:**
    -   Implementation of a modular monolith in Kotlin.
    -   Legacy architecture update in PHP to hexagonal architecture.
